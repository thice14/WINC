COMMAND LINE INTERFACE ï¿½ INTRODUCTION

Operating Systems (OS)

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux
* Unix
* iOS
* Android

An operating system is basically the base software running on a device.

What is a Command Line Interface (CLI)? And why do computers have one?

Before computers had screens, they printed their output straight on paper.

When screens were introduced to computers, all input still had to be done by typing. A mouse or a trackpad did not exist yet. The screen was simply showing what otherwise would have been printed before.

Revolution followed! The Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI is a visual way for the computer to interact with the user. A mouse was introduced then as well. It allowed to work in several windows at the same time without showing all code required to run those windows.

CLIs are older than GUIs. Most operating systems still have CLIs. Exceptions are iOS and Android(?).

CLI Basics

* Type a command
* Press Enter
* Stuff happens
* Get feedback
* You see a new line where you can type a command

What can you do with a Command Line?

* Lots of things that you can also do with the GUI
* Manage files
* Manage your OS
* Install applications
* Starting/stopping applications
* Exception: work with graphical/visual programs. Example: you can NOT enter values in a cell in Excel through a command in a CLI. 
What do developers do with the Command Line?

* Manage files in projects
* Start new projects
* Install software needed for development. Lots of developer software does not have a GUI
* Automate certain tasks

Non-Operating System Command Line Interfaces

* Console in browser
* Programming language REPLs 

These are CLIs, but they are not operating system CLIs!

Terminology

Command Line: An umbrella term. Somewhere on a computer (or phone or tablet) where you can type commands.

Terminal (application): The application that allows you type in commands. On a Mac the application is called Terminal. There is another installable application for Mac which is called iTerm. On Windows you can open Windows Terminal (cmd.exe). 

Console: A confusing word since it is usually a physical device. In digital crafts Console also often refers to the CLI of a browser.

Shell: The software running inside of a terminal that allows you to interact with the operating system. You can run different shells on a terminal.

Examples of Shells:

* Powershell
* Zsh
* Bash
* Fish

Prompt: The characters before the cursor on each new command line. The default prompt will be different per shell and can be configured.

REPL

REPL is the Command Line Interface for a programming language.

* Read (R)
* Evaluate (E)
* Print (P)
* Loop (L)
