COMMAND LINE INTERFACE Ð TIPSThese tips work regardless of your OS. Specific commands can work slightly different though.Do not be scared to try most stuff! Except removing files! If you delete files through a CLI those files are usually deleted permanently! They are not first sent to the trash bin as would happen when you delete files in a GUI. Gone for good, be careful!Keep your GUI close when you are trying stuff. When you try out simple commands in a CLI, keep the directory you are going to work in, also open in your GUI and see the visual results appear in your GUI as a result of your CLI input. To create a file in shell zsh, use the command: touch X.extension (f.e.: touch test.txt)Arrow up: In most CLIs you can recall your previous inputs by pressing arrow up. Thereby you can just edit a previous input, instead of writing the complete input again. Press one time arrow up to recall your last input, two times for your penultimate input, etc.History: By pressing arrow up you are basically going through your history of inputs. You can also get an overview of your last inputs. A few examples of input to find the history of your inputs in shell zsh: * History | tail (=last 10 entries of this session)* History 0 (=all entries of this session)* History 4 10 (=entries between 4 and 10)Autocompletion: By tapping TAB in your CLI you can autocomplete a file name. If there are various files with largely the same name, the command line will be auto completed up until the point where values start to differ. Just by pressing TAB.VSCode also has an access point to Terminal.
