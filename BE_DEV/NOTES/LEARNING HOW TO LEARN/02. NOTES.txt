NOTES

1. Why are notes important?

* Making notes helps with learning: describe things in your owns words, creating your own structure.
* Broad knowledge + specific knowledge + good notes = Lit!

p.s.: you don�t need to remember everything!

Knowing that something exists that helps you to fix problem X is more important than knowing every solution from the top of your head.

2. Paper

Writing on paper has certain advantages, but it has a lot of limitations as well. Especially with technical subjects!

Option: write (some) notes on paper and then scan them with an �Optical Character Recognition� program so you can search them later.

3. Search

Search is one of the most important things when making notes.

If you make notes in text (.txt) or in Markdown format (https://www.markdownguide.org/), you can easily search through them. Making backups is easy too!

4. Close to Code 

Keep your notes close to your code. 

* A lot of concepts are easier to (re-) understand with runnable code close by.
* Comments: more specific descriptions per line of code

- Adding code to your notes:
	# inline
	# separate folders/files

- Adding notes to your code:
	# comments 
	# separate files

5. Adding Visuals

* Brain friendly
* Works really well for some concepts
* Works less well for other concepts
* Use a search engine for other people�s visualisations of concepts

Tools to create visuals:
	- https://app.diagrams.net/
	- Paint
	- Paper + photo
	- Anything that works

Animations are sometimes even better if you can find them. Don�t make them. To make animations is too time consuming!

To add visualisations to your notes is quite easy in most apps.

Also possible with plain text or Markdown 

Another option is linking to online images, animations, videos, etc.

6. Small Runnable Example/Code

* Small, focused
* Immediately runnable
* With notes:
	- comments
	- separate file

Public small runnable examples:
	- https://gridbyexample.com/examples/
	- https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/common-flexbox-patterns/
	- https://reactjsexample.com/

If you want to search for (runnable) examples, search for:
	- �X (language) by example�
	- �snippets� (of code)
	- for frontend components: �design systems�

7. Make relations between concepts

Your brain loves connections!

* Visual relationships: mindmaps
* Link notes to others notes (apps)
* Add �related� section in your notes
* Folders in folders in folders 

8. Reviewing Notes

Remember the forgetting curve!

At the start and/or end of your day: look through some old and some new notes. Do some active recall.

9. Apps

* Evernote
* OneNote
* Notion.so
* Bear
* VSCode: make your own structure
* .. and way more

Make sure the app has an export function!

10. Backups

* Local backup
* Dropbox/OneDrive/iCloud
* Cloud-connected apps
* GitHub (private repository)
